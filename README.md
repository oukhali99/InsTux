# Installation
(example commands here are for Ubuntu/Debian)

0. install some basic dependencies
    ```
    sudo apt-get install cmake g++ gdb git zlib1g-dev
    ```

1. make sure your `g++` version is at least 6.0. On Ubuntu/Debian:
    ```
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gcc-6 g++-6
    sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-6 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-6
    ```
    Also here is AimTux's tutorial page for updating g++ if you need further information.
    [How to update g++](https://github.com/AimTuxOfficial/AimTux/wiki/Updating-your-compiler)
    
    You will also need to install the corresponding g++ multilib, on Ubuntu/Debian:
    ```
    sudo apt-get install gcc-6-multilib g++-6-multilib
    ```
    
2. clone the repository with recursive flag and cd to its root directory
    ```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/flint201/InsTux
    cd InsTux
    ```

3. generate the Makefile 
    ```
    git clean -fdx
    cmake .
    ```

4. build
    ```
    make
    ```
5. build with GUI (optional)

    InsTux comes with an optional GUI support, to build the project with GUI, you will need to install the 32-bit version of libSDL2-dev package, on Ubuntu/Debian, use the following commands:
    ```
    sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libmirclient-dev:i386 libpulse-dev:i386 libxi-dev:i386 libxkbcommon-dev:i386 libegl1-mesa:i386 libwayland-egl1-mesa:i386 libsdl2-2.0-0:i386 libsdl2-dev:i386
    ```
    After that, run
    ```
    cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    ```
    or
    ```
    cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
    ```


    Finally, run `make` to build.

    (To disable GUI, run `cmake . -DWITH_GUI=OFF {other args here}` and then run `make`.)

At this point if you see a file called `libInsTux.so` in you directory, you have succeessfully compiled the hack.
To use, start the game and wait until it reaches main menu, then run `./load` in the repo directory.
```
Insurgency PID: 12229

[New LWP 12230]
...
Using host libthread_db library "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1".
0xf77cdc89 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
$1 = (void *) 0x40d6eb70
$2 = 0x0
```

If the last line of the output shows `$2 = 0x0` like this it means the hack has successfully loaded. You should also see the following output in your game console.

```
++++ InsTux starting...
++++ InsTux loading complete! ++++
```

# Config
After running the hack, a config file will be generated in your home directory `~/.instux.cfg`. 

If you are not using the GUI, you can edit the file to change the settings. You will need to reload the hack in order for the changes to take effect.

If you wish to restore the default config, simply delete or rename `~/.instux.cfg`, and it will be generated for you. You may have to re-generate the config file after updating, since the items in the config file may change.
